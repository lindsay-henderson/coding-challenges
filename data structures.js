//constants don't matter:  ie O(500) = O(1)
//arithmetic assignment is constant
//variable assignment is constant
//accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
//in a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop * complexity of what happens inside the loop
//nested loops are potentially n²

//O(n² + 5 + 8) = O(n2)
